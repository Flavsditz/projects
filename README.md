My personal projects repository

## Sorting Folder
This contains:
-Python script that has different implementations of sorting algorithms to test them.
..-The idea came from Challenge 22 of [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) and I decided to create s simple script where I could test for myself the different algorithms. This is done in python although I have once implemented in C during a university class.

## AI Folder
Implementations of projects I did of AI, for classes or for myself. This contains:
-Tree generator for AISpace program used in class assignment.

---

## Scotland Yard Folder
This folder contains:
-Scripts and supporting files for creating a program which can track, give probabilities of places, history and other information on "Mr.X" of the Scotland Yard game.
..-This is a fun project I have been, every once and a while, working on based on the game which has the same name. Since I learned to play the game I found it interesting because it is basically a huge Graph excercise and those are always fun.

## eyeTracking Folder
This folder contains:
-All the files beeing used to implement my eyetracking solution. Still under heavy development it is my first approach to a multiscreen application using pygtk.
